Transcripts wav. audio files using whisper.ai

First mp4 files are changed into wav files as whisper.ai works only with that type.
Then the audiotrack is transcribed by the medium model as the small model was not precise enough and the processing time of the large model is very long.
The transcription is translated into a Word document.
